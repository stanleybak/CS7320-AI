Focus on the __cleaning phase__ which starts when the robot is activated and ends when the last dirty square in the room has been cleaned. Someone else will take care of the agent program needed to navigate back to the charging station after the room is clean.\n","\n","## PEAS description of the cleaning phase\n","\n","__Performance Measure:__ Each action costs 1 energy unit. The performance is measured as the sum of the energy units used to clean the whole room.\n","\n","__Environment:__ A room with $n \\times n$ squares where $n = 5$. Dirt is randomly placed on each square with probability $p = 0.2$. For simplicity, you can assume that the agent knows the size and the layout of the room (i.e., it knows $n$). To start, the agent is placed on a random square.\n","\n","__Actuators:__ The agent can clean the current square (action `suck`) or move to an adjacent square by going `north`, `east`, `south`, or `west`.\n","\n","__Sensors:__ Four bumper sensors, one for north, east, south, and west; a dirt sensor reporting dirt in the current square.  \n","\n","\n","## The agent program for a simple randomized agent\n","\n","The agent program is a function that gets sensor information (the current percepts) as the arguments. The arguments are:\n","\n","* A dictionary with boolean entries for the for bumper sensors `north`, `east`, `west`, `south`. E.g., if the agent is on the north-west corner, `bumpers` will be `{\"north\" : True, \"east\" : False, \"south\" : False, \"west\" : True}`.\n","* The dirt sensor produces a boolean.\n","\n","The agent returns the chosen action as a string.\n","\n","Here is an example implementation for the agent program of a simple randomized agent:  "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"2fDxkbCajF_f"},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","\n","actions = [\"north\", \"east\", \"west\", \"south\", \"suck\"]\n","\n","def simple_randomized_agent(bumpers, dirty):\n","    return np.random.choice(actions)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"QrLrE1XPjF_g","outputId":"9db12e5d-760c-44ce-e620-6be9b8877f20"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["'south'"]},"execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# define percepts (current location is NW corner and it is dirty)\n","bumpers = {\"north\" : True, \"east\" : False, \"south\" : False, \"west\" : True}\n","dirty = True\n","\n","# call agent program function with percepts and it returns an action\n","simple_randomized_agent(bumpers, dirty)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GB5AWgpmjF_g"},"source":["__Note:__ This is not a rational intelligent agent.

Make sure that you use the latest version of this notebook. Sync your forked repository and pull the latest revision.\n","2. Your implementation can use libraries like math, numpy, scipy, but not libraries that implement intelligent agents or complete search algorithms. Try to keep the code simple! In this course, we want to learn about the algorithms and we often do not need to use object-oriented design.\n","3. You notebook needs to be formatted professionally.\n","    - Add additional markdown blocks for your description, comments in the code, add tables and use mathplotlib to produce charts where appropriate\n","    - Do not show debugging output or include an excessive amount of output.\n","    - Check that your PDF file is readable. For example, long lines are cut off in the PDF file. You don't have control over page breaks, so do not worry about these.\n","4. Document your code.

E.g, by removing dirt from a square or moving the agent around unless there is a wall in the way.\n","* Keep track of the performance measure. That is, track the agent's actions until all dirty squares are clean and count the number of actions it takes the agent to complete the task.\n","\n","The easiest implementation for the environment is to hold an 2-dimensional array to represent if squares are clean or dirty and to call the agent function in a loop until all squares are clean or a predefined number of steps have been reached (i.e., the robot runs out of energy).\n","\n","The simulation environment should be a function like the `simple_environment()` and needs to work with the simple randomized agent program from above. **Use the same environment for all your agent implementations in the tasks below.**\n","\n","*Note on debugging:* Debugging is difficult. Make sure your environment prints enough information when you use `verbose = True`.
