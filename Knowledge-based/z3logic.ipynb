Modern Sudoku was likely invented by Howard Garns from Connersville, Indiana and was first published in 1979 under the name *Number Place*. The objective of the puzzle is to place numbers 1-9 on a 9$\\times$9 grid, such that each number occurs only once in every row, every column, and every of the nine 3$\\times$3 sub-grids that compose the main grid.\n",
        "Sudoku puzzles are grids that have been partially occupied with numbers. The task is then to occupy the remaining fields in such a way that the constraints on rows, columns, and sub-grids are satisfied.\n",
